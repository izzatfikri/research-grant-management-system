# Overview

The **ResearchGrant Hub System** is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management of research grants within academic institutions. This project aims to streamline the processes involved in grant administration by providing a centralized platform for various user roles, including academicians, administrators, and IRMC staff.

The system allows academicians to manage milestones, view grant details, and track the progress of their research projects. Administrators can oversee user management, assign roles, and ensure the integrity of the grant management process. IRMC staff are equipped to update and monitor grant information, keeping the data accurate and up-to-date.

Key features of the ResearchGrant Hub System include user authentication, intuitive dashboards for tracking grant statuses, and tools for collaboration and communication among users. The project is developed with a focus on enhancing efficiency, improving data accuracy, and fostering a transparent research environment.

This repository contains the complete source code, documentation, and instructions for setting up and running the ResearchGrant Hub System. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we strive to improve the platform and its functionalities.
